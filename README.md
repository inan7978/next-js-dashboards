## Types of metadata

There are various types of metadata, each serving a unique purpose. Some common types include:

Title Metadata: Responsible for the title of a webpage that is displayed on the browser tab. It's crucial for SEO as it helps search engines understand what the webpage is about.

<title>Page Title</title>
Description Metadata: This metadata provides a brief overview of the webpage content and is often displayed in search engine results.

<meta name="description" content="A brief description of the page content." />
Keyword Metadata: This metadata includes the keywords related to the webpage content, helping search engines index the page.

<meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3" />
Open Graph Metadata: This metadata enhances the way a webpage is represented when shared on social media platforms, providing information such as the title, description, and preview image.

<meta property="og:title" content="Title Here" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Description Here" />
<meta property="og:image" content="image_url_here" />
Favicon Metadata: This metadata links the favicon (a small icon) to the webpage, displayed in the browser's address bar or tab.

<link rel="icon" href="path/to/favicon.ico" />
